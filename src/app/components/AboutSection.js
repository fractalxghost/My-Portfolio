        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a passionate Creative Technologist with a knack for blending innovative technology with user-centric design.
          My journey in the tech world has been driven by a curiosity to explore how digital tools can solve real-world
          problems and create meaningful interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in full-stack development and a keen interest in the potential of Artificial Intelligence,
          I strive to build applications that are not only functional and efficient but also aesthetically pleasing and
          intuitive to use. I believe in continuous learning and am always exploring new frameworks, languages, and
          design principles to stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it&apos;s developing a complex web application, designing an interactive AI agent, or architecting a scalable
          backend, my goal is to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed expectations. I thrive in collaborative
          environments and enjoy the process of turning an idea into a tangible, impactful product.
